# Sentiment_Analysis
In this session we walk through a real world python machine learning project using the sci-kit learn library. We work our way to build a classification model that automatically classifies text (which has been converted to numerical vectors, using bag of words (BOW) method) as either having a positive or negative sentiment.Here we use amazon books reviews as our training data.

# Note
Encountered issues while uploading the data folder containing the training data file in json format, So I uploaded the file directly.
